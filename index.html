    <p> Unfortunately, human memory cannot keep memories forever, and over time, even the brightest moments of our lives lose their colors. Sometimes we just forget about the events of the past, and sometimes we replace some by remembering others, because it is impossible to remember every day we live. But you must admit, it would be interesting to look at excerpts from youth, to see once again happy moments, events, and even simple daily worries of the past, because times are changing, and we are changing with them.We don't have the ability to shed frozen footage and every day it gets more blurry and fuzzy. And, probably, precisely for this reason, today it is difficult to imagine your life without photography - an incredible human invention that allows you to literally stop time and capture an important moment. This discovery quickly became part of everyday life.The first known attempt at chemical fixation was by Thomas Wedgwood and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%94%D1%8D%D0%B2%D0%B8,_%D0%93%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%84%D1%80%D0%B8" class="href"> Humphrey Davy</a>. Already in 1802, they could receive photograms using silver salts, without knowing how to fix them. The first practical success on the way to the appearance of photography was the invention of heliography (fr. Héliographie) by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%81,_%D0%9D%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80" class="href" >Nicéphore Niépce</a>.Before there was a camera in our usual form, it went a long way of improvement, and you probably think that the photo studios that are now popular appeared much later, but in fact they already existed in the nineteenth century! In the 1840s-1850s, the first French, German, and English photo studios were opened - that was the name of the first photo studios, which differed significantly from modern ones. Just imagine, about 25 people worked in such an atelier. In addition to the camera and a tripod, there was certainly a chair and a head clip in the salon, since the exposure of the frame took several minutes, it was necessary to fix the client in one position, a dubious pleasure, agree?</p>

    You’re probably aware that there are far more styles and types of photography than just wedding, landscape and portrait.However, you may be surprised to know just how many genres of this wonderful art there actually are!We’ll describe the most common types of photography, like these: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%8B+%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE+%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2&rlz=1C1CHZN_ruES973ES973&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi51YfX79H9AhWDTOUKHZD4D80Q_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1920&bih=969&dpr=1" class="href">Portrait Photography</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Still+Life+Photography%2C&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwi3yf3X79H9AhWzWaQEHfgrAPEQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=Still+Life+Photography%2C&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIFCAAQgAQyBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB5Q6AhYqQpg1h5oAHAAeACAAZgBiAH7AZIBAzEuMZgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nsAEAwAEB&sclient=img&ei=6GYLZLe1F7OzkdUP-NeAiA8&bih=969&biw=1920&rlz=1C1CHZN_ruES973ES973#imgrc=xiCEWsS2wOhHJM" class="href"> Still Life Photography</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=architectural+photography&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiPvZT979H9AhV6aqQEHWRpCfAQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=Architectural+Photography&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgAMgUIABCABDIECAAQHjIECAAQHjIECAAQHjIECAAQHjIECAAQHjIECAAQHjIECAAQHjIECAAQHjIECAAQHjoGCAAQBxAeUMIGWKMIYMARaABwAHgAgAFUiAGhAZIBATKYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ7ABAMABAQ&sclient=img&ei=NmcLZI_KFfrUkdUP5NKlgA8&bih=969&biw=1920&rlz=1C1CHZN_ruES973ES973#imgrc=jLm3Ida2qNtE9M"  class="href">Architectural Photography</a>,<a href= "https://www.google.com/search?q=Fashion+Photography&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjMsfW08NH9AhXLrycCHVVbCZMQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=Fashion+Photography&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIECAAQQzIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIECAAQHjIECAAQHjIECAAQHjIECAAQHjIECAAQHjIECAAQHjoGCAAQBxAeUNMKWO0NYPoQaABwAHgAgAFNiAGYAZIBATKYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ7ABAMABAQ&sclient=img&ei=q2cLZIywEcvfnsEP1balmAk&bih=969&biw=1920&rlz=1C1CHZN_ruES973ES973#imgrc=CC7CsTqhBSn0FM" class="href"> Fashion Photography</a>.But stylish photos are actually much more than that. By clicking on the name of the style you can see many examples. You can find out more by clicking the link on the right.So let's get started!
 <ol>
   <li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%8B+%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE+%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2&rlz=1C1CHZN_ruES973ES973&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi51YfX79H9AhWDTOUKHZD4D80Q_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1920&bih=969&dpr=1" class="href">Portrait Photography</a>. One of the most common photography styles, portrait photography, or portraiture, aims to capture the personality and mood of an individual or group. Images may be candid or posed, full body or close-ups. Either way, the subject’s face and eyes are typically in focus. Lighting and backdrop help to convey tone and emotion. Popular types of photography portraits include senior portraits, family portraits, engagement photos, and professional headshots. The best portrait photographers make clients feel completely comfortable, so that their expressions are natural and relaxed.</li>
   <li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Still+Life+Photography%2C&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwi3yf3X79H9AhWzWaQEHfgrAPEQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=Still+Life+Photography%2C&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIFCAAQgAQyBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB5Q6AhYqQpg1h5oAHAAeACAAZgBiAH7AZIBAzEuMZgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nsAEAwAEB&sclient=img&ei=6GYLZLe1F7OzkdUP-NeAiA8&bih=969&biw=1920&rlz=1C1CHZN_ruES973ES973#imgrc=xiCEWsS2wOhHJM" class="href">Still Life Photography</a>. Like it sounds, still life photography features inanimate objects—natural or manmade. Still life photography can be artistic or commercial. It is commonly used in stock photography as well as product advertising. (Think of the product images shown in catalogs, magazines, and billboards.) For still life photographers, object selection, arrangement, and lighting are key to getting a great shot.</li>

Both the interior and exterior design of buildings and structures are the subject of architectural photography. From warehouses to city bridges to old country barns, this genre encompasses diverse structures. Often, the photograph showcases the structure’s most aesthetically pleasing parts, such as a particular beam or archway. Interesting materials and colors may also be emphasized. Lighting can be challenging in architectural photography and, for exteriors, photographers must know how to work with natural light. Gear such as a tilt-shift lens, a tripod, and a panorama head is often useful. Architectural photographs can be of value to designers, architects, leasing companies, and building investors.</li>

Fashion photography showcases and glamorizes fashion clothing, shoes, and accessories to make them more desirable to consumers. It is commonly published in magazines and online. People may choose this niche over different types of photography because of the opportunity to be highly creative in making photographs eye-catching and appealing. Fashion photographers take a lot of full body shots and work in an array of locations, from fashion shows to studios with full lighting setups to city streets and open fields. They utilize many of the same skills as portrait photographers and must practice good teamwork and communication when working with shoot stylists, creative directors, and models.</li>

  Many people first start taking pictures, and later some have a desire to understand why not all photographs evoke emotions in people. I think that you can yourself remember the pictures that made you draw attention to yourself.We do not mean when you look at photographs of your relatives or acquaintances with pleasure. We are talking about pictures that can be attributed to works of art. The plots in all such photographs are usually different, people may be present, or maybe only nature or buildings in the frame, but all these pictures have one thing in common - the right composition. Composition in photography is the harmonious arrangement of all elements of the image in the picture. Here we will consider several basic types of composition such as:<br> <a href="https://petapixel.com/photography-composition-techniques/#5_Leading_Lines" class="href">  Leading Lines</a>,<a href="https://petapixel.com/photography-composition-techniques/#1_Rule_of_Thirds" class="href" >Rule of Thirds</a>,<a href="https://petapixel.com/photography-composition-techniques/#2_Centered_Composition_and_Symmetry" class="href" >Centered Composition and Symmetry</a>.So let's get started!
  <ol>
    <li><a href= "https://petapixel.com/photography-composition-techniques/#5_Leading_Lines" class=href>Leading Lines</a>. Leading lines help lead the viewer through the image and focus attention on important elements. Anything from paths, walls, or patterns can be used as leading lines. Leading lines do not necessarily have to be straight . In fact, curved lines can be very attractive compositional features</li>
    <li> <a href="https://petapixel.com/photography-composition-techniques/#1_Rule_of_Thirds" class="href">Rule of Thirds.</a>The rule of thirds is very simple. You divide the frame into 9 equal rectangles, 3 across and 3 down. Many camera manufacturers have actually included the capability to display this grid in live view mode.</li>
    <li> <a href="https://petapixel.com/photography-composition-techniques/#2_Centered_Composition_and_Symmetry" class="href">Centered Composition and Symmetry</a> There are times when placing a subject in the center of the frame works really well. Symmetrical scenes are perfect for a centered composition. They look really well in square frames too.Scenes containing reflections are also a great opportunity to use symmetry in your composition.</li>
